# Theremin-Learning-Device-using-Nuvoton-NUC140-MCU-
Creating a Theremin-like device using Nuvoton NUC140 MCU with 2 ultrasonic detectors, passive buzzer and the LCD screen for guidance and different features.

Theremin is known for one of the most difficult instruments to learn. This system implements a theremin-like device using 2 ultrasonic detectors for the positions of the two hands (one determines volume, the other one pitch), in alliance with that it creates a PWM signal for the passive buzzer. The frequency of the PWM will determine the pitch and the duty cycle will determine the voloume.

The device also includes an interface for the user that will guide him to play certain songs (showing him the note that needs to be played, the note being played by him, the direction of the hand for getting the right note and the volume). Another option is to play the device will seeing graphically the notes being played (meaning the elipse with five lines). Another option is for the user to record his playing. The user can choose each of the giving options in the menu using the keypad of the board.
